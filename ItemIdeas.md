What sort of items would you like to create?




Right now, I am planning on ...

A camera, which will take a snapshot an object (done -- Camera)


## Suggestion from J@ ##

_TrapBase_

A couple of different traps are done as of [r208](https://code.google.com/p/tzmud/source/detail?r=208).

GetTrap springs when someone tries to pick it up.

GetTimeTrap is activated when someone tries to pick it up, but springs some time later.

I think the QuicksandTrap would be better done as a Trap(Room) subclass.

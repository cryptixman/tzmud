INSTALLING

First install the requirements:
    Python (http://www.python.org/)
        [tested with Python-2.5.2]
    Twisted (http://twistedmatrix.com/)
        [tested with Twisted-8.1.0]
    ZODB3 (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ZODB3/)
        [tested with ZODB3-3.8.1b6]
    Pyparsing (http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/)
        [tested with Pyparsing-1.4.7]

Unpack the TZMud distribution and run the
TZMud control program tzcontrol.py with:
    python tzcontrol.py -s

That command will generate an empty configuration
file at etc/conf.py where you can add changes to
the settings from etc/defaults.py


RUNNING

The first time you run the server, run the TZMud
control program as:
    python tzcontrol -f

That command will generate a "fresh" database with
a few users and a couple of rooms. Be sure to change
the passwords for those users if you plan to put the
server on the internet.


CONNECTING

Use a MUD client (or telnet if you want to play the
old-school way). The default port is 4444. If you
are running the server on your own computer, try
connecting to localhost:4444 or 127.0.0.1:4444

INSTALLING

First install the requirements:
    Python (http://www.python.org/)
        [tested with Python-2.5.2]
    Twisted (http://twistedmatrix.com/)
        [tested with Twisted-8.1.0]
    ZODB3 (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ZODB3/)
        [tested with ZODB3-3.8.1b6]
    Pyparsing (http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/)
        [tested with Pyparsing-1.4.7]

    If you want to run the (optional) web server,
        you will also need:
        Nevow (http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/DivmodNevow)
            [tested with Nevow-0.9.31]

Unpack the TZMud distribution and run the
TZMud control program tzcontrol.py with:
    python tzcontrol.py -s

That command will generate an empty configuration
file at etc/conf.py where you can add changes to
the settings from etc/defaults.py


RUNNING

If you want to start with a minimal world, then
the first time you run the server, run the TZMud
control program as:
    python tzcontrol.py -f

That command will generate a "fresh" database with
a couple of simple rooms. The first character you
create will be an administrator.

If you would like to use the more built up world
that is included with the distribution, then run
the TZMud control program as:
    python tzcontrol.py -z

That command will restore the database 0.Data.fs
from the var/db/backup directory. All players
have been removed from the database, so you will
still be able to create the first admin character.


CONNECTING

Use a MUD client (or telnet if you want to play the
old-school way). The default port is 4444. If you
are running the server on your own computer, try
connecting to localhost:4444 or 127.0.0.1:4444

Once connected, create a character with
    create <make up a name> <make up a password>
(Do not include the angle brackets <>)

The first character created will be an administrator.

TZMud is a Python MUD server.
http://tzmud.googlecode.com/

A MUD is a text-based virtual environment
accessed via telnet, or with a specialised
MUD client.

TZMud development is still in early stages,
focusing on API and server stability.

TZMud uses several high-quality Python
libraries to facilitate rapid development:
    Twisted, ZODB, and Pyparsing.

TZMud is released under GPLv3.

Changes in TZMud-0.6:
    - fix for server only accepting 1 connection
    - added SmallRoom

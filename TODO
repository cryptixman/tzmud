# MUD Server
- unify parsed object names so that all parse actions can access
    the same set of objects. Right now, some actions cannot access
    objects with names that have "to " in them, while others are
    blind to "as " or "is ".
- think about having .room only on player, not on protocol.
- look for any other attrs that might get corrupted by someone
    manually setting something. (like character.room)
- remember most recently used item, so that a pronoun will work.
    for example ...
    get rose
    drop it
- minotaur mob digs a maze and patrols it
- combat system
- skill system
- expand the initial world
- Die item -- magical attack
- Human/Humanoid mob for subclassing
- remove old-style password verification in v0.9
- allow cloning special Exit types
- potion of see invisible things
- item exchanging (give, take, accept, steal)
- better info output so people can tell which object is which
- Group items with the same name in the inventory (ie. 2 roses)
- fix tzcontrol to work properly on windows
- set ownership for cloned objects
- set_* methods as customized setting setters for objects
    for instance, objects could have a set_owner method which
    looks up the supplied word as the name of a character
    and uses that to set the owner of the object.
- add a new .parent attribute for objects to indicate
    which room it is in, which character is
    carrying it, or which container it is in.
- room actions should pass through to items in containers
- CrystalBall item which can locate/spy on objects
- item for detecting invisible things...
    "you sense something you cannot see..."
- add Region object to group Rooms
- a way to export objects from / import objects to the database
- better messages when mis-using wizard or admin commands

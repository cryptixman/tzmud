# MUD Server
- unify parsed object names so that all parse actions can access
    the same set of objects. Right now, some actions cannot access
    objects with names that have "to " in them, while others are
    blind to "as " or "is ".
- allow exits to react to actions
- think about having .room only on player, not on protocol.
- look for any other attrs that might get corrupted by someone
    manually setting something. (like character.home)
- aka names for players, rooms, mobs, etc.
- remember most recently used item, so that a pronoun will work.
    for example ...
    get rose
    drop it
- minotaur mob digs a maze and patrols it
- combat system
- show possible Rooms, Items, and Mobs in @list commands

# Web Server
- Build MUD areas by web.

# MUD Server
- unify parsed object names so that all parse actions can access
    the same set of objects. Right now, some actions cannot access
    objects with names that have "to " in them, while others are
    blind to "as " or "is ".
- think about having .room only on player, not on protocol.
- look for any other attrs that might get corrupted by someone
    manually setting something. (like character.room)
- remember most recently used item, so that a pronoun will work.
    for example ...
    get rose
    drop it
- minotaur mob digs a maze and patrols it
- combat system
- skill system
- expand the initial world
- Die item -- magical attack
- Human/Humanoid mob for subclassing
- remove old-style password verification in v0.9
- allow cloning special Exit types
- potion of see invisible things
    or SeeInvRing allows character to see invisible things
- item exchanging (give, take, accept, steal)
- better info output so people can tell which object is which
- Group items with the same name in the inventory (ie. 2 roses)
- fix tzcontrol to work properly on windows
- set ownership for cloned objects
- CrystalBall item which can locate/spy on objects
- add Region object to group Rooms
- a way to export objects from / import objects to the database
- should be able to use the mirror
- more general "use" framework
    maybe pass everything after "use thing" for further parsing
- allow settings that are lists (and append/delete from lists)
- fix ordering of messages when characters are following someone
- objects that affect attributes might step on each other
    for instance, character might be wearing an InvRing, then
    take an InvPotion, then remove the InvRing. Should stay
    invisible until the potion wears out, but right now will
    be visible
- cloning an existing object should create an exact copy (except
    for tzid) not a default instance of the object's class

    to solve this, I am considering a sort of "modifier stack"
- add all TODO items to the googlecode issue tracker
- allow players to set their own short and long descriptions
- allow Spawner to spawn more than 1 of its mobtype in the room
- create a plugin system

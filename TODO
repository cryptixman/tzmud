# MUD Server
- Give objects __add__ methods so they can combine with strings
    without having to cast to strings.
- unify parsed object names so that all parse actions can access
    the same set of objects. Right now, some actions cannot access
    objects with names that have "to " in them, while others are
    blind to "as " or "is ".
- allow exits to react to actions
- make character.home read-only. This should only be set by the
    .move() method because a player also needs to have its
    connection updated with the new room.

    Another possibility (maybe better...) would be to make the
    room a property on the connection and read that dynamically
    from the player.
- look for any other attrs that might get corrupted by someone
    manually setting something. (like character.home)
- aka names for players, rooms, mobs, etc.
- remember most recently used item, so that a pronoun will work.
    for example ...
    get rose
    drop it
- minotaur mob digs a maze and patrols it
- combat system
- switch everything over to new message style
- try unlocking with any key you are holding automatically
- add a wizard action @lock to lock any door

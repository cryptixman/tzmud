# MUD Server
- unify parsed object names so that all parse actions can access
    the same set of objects. Right now, some actions cannot access
    objects with names that have "to " in them, while others are
    blind to "as " or "is ".
- think about having .room only on player, not on protocol.
- look for any other attrs that might get corrupted by someone
    manually setting something. (like character.room)
- remember most recently used item, so that a pronoun will work.
    for example ...
    get rose
    drop it
- minotaur mob digs a maze and patrols it
- stats
- combat system
- skill system
- expand the initial world
- think about a better way to re-weight mob actions
- Die item -- magical attack

# Web Server
